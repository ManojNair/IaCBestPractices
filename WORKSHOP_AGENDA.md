# Infrastructure as Code Best Practices for Enterprise Azure Deployments
## 90-Minute Workshop Agenda - Based on "Infrastructure as Code, 3rd Edition" Principles

### Duration: 90 minutes
### Target Audience: Enterprise DevOps Engineers, Cloud Architects, and Platform Engineers
### Framework: Kief Morris's IaC Principles and Patterns

---

## Workshop Overview
This hands-on workshop applies the core principles from "Infrastructure as Code, 3rd Edition" to enterprise Azure deployments. We'll implement the three IaC patterns - **Stack Pattern**, **Pipeline Pattern**, and **Environment Pattern** - while deploying secure Ubuntu VMs using Terraform, Ansible, and GitHub Actions.

### **Core IaC Principles Covered:**
1. **Definition Clarity**: Infrastructure defined as code with version control
2. **Unattended Execution**: Fully automated deployment without manual intervention  
3. **Idempotency**: Safe to run repeatedly with consistent results
4. **Immutable Infrastructure**: Replace rather than modify running infrastructure
5. **Disposable Infrastructure**: Easy to recreate from scratch
6. **Consistency**: Identical deployment across all environments
7. **Reliability**: Predictable outcomes with proper error handling
